    excerpt:
      "How the Maison's setters compose surfaces of light from thousands of individual stones — and why it still takes a year of training.",
    body: `In the Paris atelier, the head of pavé works at a small bench by the window, with a loupe, a steel tool no larger than a pin, and a pile of diamonds sorted by size, weight, and refraction. To pavé — literally, to pave — is to set diamonds so closely that the metal between them disappears and what remains is light.

It is the Maison's oldest technique, and the most demanding. Every stone must sit at the same depth, the same plane, the same angle to the light. The setter works freehand, judging each placement by eye, then locks the stone with four micro-prongs raised from the metal. A pavé surface of 1,200 stones may take a single setter a month.

The Heritage Pavé Necklace, reissued this season, is the latest piece in this lineage. Its 1,464 round-brilliant diamonds are set across a flexible articulated chain so that the surface remains continuous as it falls along the neck — a single uninterrupted line of light.`,

    excerpt:
      "Inside the slow making of a single high jewelry piece — emeralds matched over a year, then set in a tiara that becomes a necklace, then a brooch.",
    body: `High jewelry is, before anything else, an exercise in patience. The Lumière Emerald Tiara — last winter's flagship piece for the Maison — began as a search for stones. Five emeralds, four ovals and a central cushion, each from Muzo, each chosen for the same particular shade of green: a cool, slightly blue-leaning tone, more spring leaf than evergreen.

The match took twelve months. The setting took six more. The platinum frame is articulated in such a way that the piece can be worn three ways: a tiara above the brow, a necklace at the collar, and — when the central section is unclipped — a single brooch.

It is numbered I/I and accompanied by its own bound monograph. There will not be another.`,

    excerpt:
      "Inside the building where the Tank watches and the Trinity rings are made — a glasshouse on the lake, two floors, eighty hands.",
    body: `The Maison's manufacture in Geneva is a low glasshouse on the south shore of the lake, designed in 1968 and quietly extended four times since. Eighty people work here. Watches are assembled on the upper floor, where the light is best; rings are made on the lower one, in three small ateliers around an internal courtyard.

The Trinity Ring, the Maison's quiet daily emblem, is made entirely on this floor. The three bands — yellow, white, and rose — are drawn separately from rod stock, joined, and finished by hand. A single ring takes eight hours.

There is no music in the workshops. Only the sound of files, then a small file, then a smaller one.`,

    excerpt:
      "Why a Burmese ruby is not a Mozambican one, and how the Maison's gemmologist learned to tell them apart.",
    body: `Provenance is the first question the Maison asks of any stone. A ruby may be technically a ruby — corundum coloured by chromium — and yet read entirely differently depending on where it was formed.

The pigeon-blood rubies of Mogok, in Upper Burma, fluoresce gently red under daylight. The Mozambican stones, even at high quality, sit a half-tone darker. To the Maison's chief gemmologist, the difference is immediate; to the rest of us, it is a matter of holding two stones side by side, in turn, against the same neutral grey card.

The Aurora Ruby Ring, set with a 2.18-carat Mogok stone, is the kind of piece that makes the lesson visible.`,

    excerpt:
      "After eighteen months of restoration, the rue de la Paix flagship returns to its 1923 plan — with one thoughtful addition.",
    body: `The Paris boutique, at the corner of rue de la Paix and rue Daunou, was built in 1923 as a small two-storey commerce. After eighteen months of restoration this winter, it has reopened, returned as closely as possible to its original plan.

The marble floor — the same Carrara as in the Maison's archive photographs — has been re-laid. The brass vitrines, removed in 1986, have been reproduced from the period drawings.

The single addition is a small high jewelry salon at the back of the second floor, lined in oak and lit only by candles in the evening. It is reserved by appointment and seats six.`,
